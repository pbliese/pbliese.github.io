			Glad you could make it! I'm Philip, a masters student at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, interested in geospatial data and visualization.  
			I've always enjoyed geography, but during high school I became significantly more invested in geography and GIS, which has led me to today.
			I seek to help move the world forward, in terms of both compiling and analyzing geospatial data, as well as by representing it through maps and other visualization.
			Through maps, a driving force for change, we can visualize the world as it's been, as it is, and how it could be. 
			I strive to always be an effective creator and analyzer, so that the world may have a brighter future.
			Thank you for viewing this page, and I hope you will also work towards a better tomorrow.

		<p>I've had an extremely diverse background in both education and work, which has given me the opportunity to visit many different places and analyze from many different angles.
			This diversity has also required me to adapt to a variety of situations, adjusting my workflow and utilizing all of my critical thinking and problem solving skills to accomplish the desired goal.
			This has allowed me to broaden my worldview, and has benefited my work significantly.
		My resume can be viewed separately <a href="assets/Philip_Resume.pdf">here</a>.
